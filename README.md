# Spring Boot basics - trainning

## About
The following repo contains a Spring Boot example that connects to an existing Database (Postgres) and uses an internal REST API that can be tested with Postman/Insomnia

## I've learned to:
* Spring Initializr at start.spring.io
* adding and changing dependencies
* connect to a database using DB Navigator plugin
* lombok annotations
* Intellij shortcuts (alt+insert) for creating/implementing methods
* JpaRepository which automatically allows main class to do a bunch of REST API methods
* the usefulness of having a Service and Repository
* common application.properties
* testing with @SpringBootTest
* routing
